Push_swap
=========

School algorithm project **push_swap**: the aim is to sort data using only two stacks and a limited set of instructions.  
Norminette codestyle.   
[**subject.pdf**](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/36359/en.subject.pdf)  

------------

Sorting 100 numbers takes an average of 660 steps  
Sorting 500 numbers takes an average of 4930 steps  
Evaluation of the algorithm by subject: 5/5

Command
-------
- sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- ss : sa and sb at the same time. 
- pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
- pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
- ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rr : ra and rb at the same time.
- rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

Installation
------------
```
git clone https://github.com/a-parfenov/Push_swap.git && cd push_swap && make
```
Run
---

Launch the visualizer, submit 100 numbers:
``` bash
python3 pyviz.py `ruby -e "puts (1..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`
```

Starting the sorting algorithm (displays only the commands used):
```
./push_swap 3 0 2 1 4
```

Launching the sorting algorithm and checker (displays the result of the work):
```
ARG="5 3 6 0 2 1 4"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
```
ARG=`ruby -e "puts (1..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
